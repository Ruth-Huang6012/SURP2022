This folder contains information on the interaction between a dark matter subhalo and a star stream, with inital conditions:
radius: 12 kpc, tangential speed: 33 km/s, radial speed: 429 km/s, z: 1.5 pc, vz: 0, mass: 1e8 solar masses

The interaction is animated in gif form, and the graphs show the density of the stars along the star stream, the histogram of tracked stars and the ratio between the histograms at times ranging from 1.1 Gyr to 1.6 Gyr. Angle and RMS are labeled in the name of the picture. The last 3 digits in the angle should be ignored.
